# SEA-LEAP
SEA-LEAP is an open source, generic architecture for Self-adaptive and Locality-aware Edge Analytics Placement. 
It consists of (1) a novel tracking mechanism, enabling tracking of dataset movements over highly distributed edge computing infrastructures; (2) a novel control mechanism, featuring
(i) a meta-scheduler service, allowing on-the-fly adaptation and deployment of analytics applications to nodes storing required dataset, and (ii) a placement optimization service, 
enabling optimized and timely analytics placement with dynamic data movement.

The current SEA-LEAP is developed in python programming language (requiring additional packages such as: ) and uses Kubernetes platform for experimental evaluation.

## DATA
The proposed algorithms are evaluated on iamge frames coming from real-world video traces, particularly collected from the InTraSafEd 5G project (newsroom.magenta.at/2020/01/16/5g-anwendungen-in-wien/) 
for increasing traffic safety with edgeand  5G,  obtained  during  the  project  evaluation. The  datasets contain sampled video frames in various sizes from the chosen Vienna’s crossroad during the  
demonstration.
